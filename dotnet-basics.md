### DotNet Bascis

This post is related with .Net introduction which is mainly talking about what is .Net?

.Net = The ecosystem which contains
  - Languages: C#, F#, VB and others
  - Runtimes: Core CLR [Common Language Runtime]
  - Libraries - BCL [Base Class Library] 3rd party, OSS (Open Source)


#### Concepts:

1). .NET CLR: Common Language Runtime which provide the runtime environment to compile the C# code and then make the app run
(Reference Link: <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/standard/clr" target="_blank">.Net CLR</a>)


2). BCL: Base Class Library is a standard C# runtime library, its like a base linrary, which ocntains `System.String`, `System.DateTime` and etc.


3). Concepts similarities:
  -- CLR = JVM (The CLR is similar with JVM [Java Vritual Machine])
  -- Nuget = NPM (Node Packages Manager)
  -- dotnet cli = your netry point, SDK, driver, javac, go, etc
  -- dotnet new = templates (what type of project you want to create)
  -- dotnet run = dev time comiple and run
  -- dotnet publish = ready up for deploy

4). Normall after build the project, we can get `.dll` and `.exe` files in order to run your app.

5). The reason why we use sqlite: easier to start and its a file based database, you can use db name same as your project name
